# Wildflower

Yarrow, common they call  
Sits leading aside the road  
Now to pleasant peaceful 'bode.  
Two feet, mine and yours, fall.  

White from top to yellow to green  
Common yarrow, each snag her eye.  
Two hands held fast twixt she and I.  
'Neath leather sole, gravel dust and stone careen.  

Atop our hill, o'er past the woundwort,  
Spectres from stock pots clanking atop fire  
Hearth and home and comfort conspire  
To make cool days warm and long walks short.
