# Gardening

It was a broken vase  
that told me of trial  
past and forgotten.
"Cultiver son jardin interieur".  
The vase was already broken
its pieces strewn about - a chaos.
"Plant my own garden.
Decorate my own soul."  
But the vase is all scattered!  
I'm digging like my old man
and his. Inner knee still braced
against the wood of the shovel - digging
for wilder flowers as a man
without a vase.
