# Gardening

It was a broken vase  
that told me of trial  
past and forgotten.
"Cultiver son jardin interieur".  
The vase was already broken
its pieces strewn about - a chaos.
"Plant my own garden.
Decorate my own soul."  
But the vase is all scattered!  
I'm digging like my old my 
and his. Inner knee still braced
against the wood - digging
for wilder flowers as a man
without a case.
