It was I, who spoke to you there on the mountain
I, who led you from the land of your trial.
My words are true and I sealed them
Through exalting your weakness and
Humiliating the strength of your captor. 
I adore you and through adoration place
You amongst my verdant pasture. 
Like your mother and her Dickenses,
I place you on my shelf with watch and care. 
Neglect what lies beyond the wall
There is nothing for you there
But death and trepidation; you are
The apple of my eye. 
Give your whole heart to me and no other,
Seek me with your soul and spirit as 
though no other thing matters.
I've got for you wine and bread,
And sustenance for the day. 
Take not from your surroundings and 
love not what I have made for you 
With the love I have given you. Create
Not no new masters, y'all former slaves. 
Seek not beyond what I have given you for
I have given you all that I have. 
Rest beneath my wings and neglect your
Folly for fortune with men from 
another land. 
When you speak of me,
speak honestly and from the heart and 
brook no lie. Take my name as though
it was your own and treasure it.
Tarnish not pure gold and 
Polish burnished bronze with care
And thanksgiving and sacred clothes. 
Rest when you are able for in 
peace and tranquility you were made.
If I can rest, the one who forged
all that you see from the raw material
of inexistence, you can take heart knowing
that in your sleep I take joy.
I am watching over you and
Nothing will come to pass which
Takes you from my grasp. 
You are made of someone. Two
were became one and from union you
Were born. Give to those who joined 
and in joining gave you breath
honor beyond your own. Grant them
hope and faith in your own 
faithfulness. Life is a pearl;
Love your own and grant others theirs.
The power of death lies not in your hands.
Nurture life, honor the dead, leave to me
What is mine and seek not beyond the wall.
The love you may share with another
Is a trove without end. I grant you but 
One boundless blessing, a pasture of
Greenest greens and most cooling shade.
Seek not what lies beyond the wall.
When you speak, speak with care for
Your words carry weight and power.
Your words might build a life worth living
And false words may tear down and destroy,
Ravaging what I have made and called it good. 
I'll give you all you need and your friend?
They'll be fed beyond their wildest dreams.
Dream not of what is their own and take
Not for yourself. You'll not go hungry when
I have my eye on you. My storehouse
Is full beyond measure with an ocean of blue.
You'll lack nothing; when I've set it aside
For you. Your love will be long in my house. Your
Companion will stay by your side. Your room 
Will be furnished well and life will be good.
Just remain here, with me and
Seek not what lies beyond the wall.
