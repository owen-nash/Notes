It was I, who spoke to you there on the mountain

I, who led you from the land of your trial.

My words are true and I sealed them -

As a noble seals a precious letter, written

In a far off land with words of great import -

Through exalting your weakness and

Humiliating the strength of your captor. 

Seek not what lies beyond the wall.


I adore you and through adoration place

You amongst my verdant pasture. 

For your own sake, I've hemmed you in 

Before and about - that you may know what it is

to be loved.

Neglect what lies beyond the wall

There is nothing for you there.

Seek not what lies beyond the wall.


Give your whole heart to me and no other,

Seek me with your soul and spirit as 

though no other thing matters.

I’ve got for you bracing wine and crusty bread.

Take not from your surroundings and 

love not what I have made for you 

With the love I have given you. 

Seek not what lies beyond the wall.


Rest beneath my wings and neglect your

Folly for fortune with men from another land. 

When you speak of me, speak honestly 

and from the heart and  brook no lie. 

Take my name as though it was your own.

Like Oropendola with her fruit, make beautiful my name - 

your house with sticks and kindling of worth

Seek not what lies beyond the wall.


Rest when you are able for in 

harmony and repose you were made.

If I can rest, the one who forged

all that you see from the raw material

of inexistence, you can take heart knowing

that in your slumber I take mirth.

In the night, I am a watchful keeper.

Seek not what lies beyond the wall.


You are made of someone. Two

were one and from union you

Were born. Give to those who joined 

and in consummation gave you breath

honor beyond your own. Grant them

hope and faith in your own faithfulness. 

Those who care, lie before and afar.

Seek not what lies beyond the wall.


Life is a pearl;

Hold dear your own and grant others theirs.

The power of destruction lies not in your hands.

Your years will be few and short but

in their shortness there will be no

Shortness of beauty should you seek

Life and land in the realm I have given.

Seek not what lies beyond the wall.



The desire you may share with another

Is a trove without end. I gave you but 

One boundless earthly blessing, a pasture of

Greenest greens and most cooling shade.

You'll make a barren place a dwelling.

She'll nest and you'll work. She'll smile

and your heart will jump for joy. 

Seek not what lies beyond the wall.


Make utterance with care for there is power.

Words might build a life worth living

And false words may tear down and destroy,

Ravaging what I have made and called it good. 

I’ll give you all you need -- and your friend?

They’ll be fed beyond their wildest dreams.

Dream not of what is their own and pilfer not.

Seek not what lies beyond the wall.


My storehouse is full beyond 

measure with an ocean of blue.

You’ll lack nothing; when I’ve set it aside

For you. Your love will be long in my house. Your

Companion will stay by your side. Your room 

Will be furnished well and life will be good.

Just remain here, with me and

Seek not what lies beyond the wall.
